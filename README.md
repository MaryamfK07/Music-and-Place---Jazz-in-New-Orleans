## Final Results

The diasporic spread of Jazz indicates the impact the genre has had on several communities. Its roots trace back to Congo Square in New Orleans, and while Jazz its mostly know for its Louisiana origins, we can see its rise occur in other big cities such as New York and Chicago. Jazz's spread among the nations shows how music and place are connected, musicians carried the genre with them through migration routes, and black communities moved north to the aforementioned cities, including others like Detroit and St. Louis. Jazz being shown to other communites also helped its diasporic spread among the nation, as seen in Chicago and Harlem during the 1920s. Musicians bring their music with them showing their works to new communities and as a result, helps their music spread from city to city. We see this with the rise of Jazz.
